# Meal-Planner üçΩÔ∏è

## Overview

**Meal-Planner** is a robust full-stack application that offers a seamless meal planning experience. Users can register, login, create recipes, and meals, and eventually compile these into a weekly meal plan.

### Problem Statement

The central issue this application tackles is the cumbersome process of meal planning. Meal-Planner generates weekly meal plans divided into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even snacks from Monday through Sunday. It also intelligently creates a grocery list based on the ingredients of the selected meals, ensuring you have everything you need for your weekly meals.

### Target Audience

The app is perfect for any adult eager to bring structure and organization to their meal planning.
